## Overview

First of all I want to thank the Front end Mentor Website for providing good challanges to a Newbie developers 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./solution%20screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
I used HTML to create 1 Big box then divided this boxes into two then then I started with the right box by divinding all its content into Flex then dividing their mini-content into flex also to get the the column style then added the color as linear for left box as i followed the procdeure of the right box then this was the result 
### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS 3
- Flexbox


### Continued development

I want to Improve this by working more on JS as I don't have the enough knowledge to make this website alive using JS
